# CyberPython 2077

This is my implementation of the [CyberPython 2077](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUU6ZsJlZKQ&ab_channel=sentdex) video from the [Sentdex channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex).

Its purpose is to use the pathing from the minimap of CyberPunk 2077 to walk through the world using OpenCV.

It is mostly the same, other than the changes for my monitor setup and resolution, the ability to turn around when the route is not found, stopping if there is no valid path and running instead of walking.
